  <h3 align="center">Intermediate Starter Kit (SASS)</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This website was made using the Intermediate Website Kit, presented by CodeStitch. This kit includes a pre-configured Eleventy environment with Nunjucks templating, along with seamless integration of Decap CMS. This setup allows you to quickly start a project while providing your client with a blog for content management. Everything is ready to go right from the start, offering a fantastic introduction to the advantages of a Static Site Generator, complete with SASS preprocessing.
